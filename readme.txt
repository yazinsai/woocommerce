= Using Wordpress + WooCommerce? =

Then you're going to love this!

This WooCommerce plugin makes integrating your store with White a walk in the park! In the same time it would take you to make a cup of some great turkish coffee, you could be up and running with online payments!

Doesn't matter if you're in Bahrain or the UAE, it'll work fine either way.

== Requirements ==

In order to start using White, please head over to [http://whitepayments.com/](our website) and register for an online account (it'll only take a few minutes; we'll wait..)

Got the account? Great .. now make sure to get the following details as well: `Live secret key`, `Test secret key` and the `Public Encryption key`. This will be needed when setting up the WooCommerce payment plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the `white-woo.zip` file to your `wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the options in the WooCommerce --> Settings --> Checkout screen.
